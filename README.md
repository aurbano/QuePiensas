> Social network Que Piensas, beta version

This project was started around 2009, at a time when the web was finally transitioning to APIs, lighter clients, JS apps... But before they were fully used. It's the last large scale website that I've built on PHP, and even for a PHP app it could have been done much better.

We learnt a lot though, not only about development but also about working in a team, managing a "large" codebase (before Git was widespread), we were actually using some old Dreamweaver version control, that had nothing to do with version control in reality.

All of this code is probably useless, but just in case it's useful to anyone in anyway, here you go.
